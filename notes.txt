Notes for STORD Engineering Team

Tech Stack
==========
* Elixir 
* Phoenix 
* ReactJS (via server rendered pages)
* Postgres DB

CI/CD
======
Note: Upon git pushes to the master branch, this app uses Github Actions to 
* run all tests, 
* verify it's formatted correctly 
* runs a static code analysis tool 

It then prepares a build and then deploys that build to a PaaS called 
Gigalixir which enabled full CI/CD.

You can find the live running app here:

How to Run the App Locally
==========================

Prerequisite
------------
** The `setup` script relies on having ASDF installed so it can install 
Elixir, Erlang and Node automatically if the plugins do not already exist. 
Please refer to https://asdf-vm.com/ for installation instructions if this 
isn't already installed on your machine. **

To start the application (after git clone), run the following:

  * Setup the project with `make setup`. 
	  
	* Please verify the generated `.env` file has correct values for your environment.
  
	* Run the backend and frontend test suites with `make test`
  
	* Start the application with `make server`
	
	* Now you can visit [`localhost:8080`](http://localhost:8080) from your browser.

Note: there's also a `make clean` target which is handy for deleting everything 
that was generated while running the application.


Assumptions
===========
* Bash scripts tested on Mac OS 11
* ASDF is available on the host machine.
* Postgres is available on the host machine with a user `postgres` and password `postgres`. 
  If this user account is not available, please modify the .env file to use the correct credentials.
